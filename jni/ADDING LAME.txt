RATIONALE: Most of the work required here is due to my inexperience with C/C++ and corresponding makefiles, including the android specific ones. So while I was trying to get everything to run, I scrambled the folder structure a bit, which then necessitated changes in various includes and so on. I will fix this in the future, but for now, follow these instructions to get everything set up as I did.

INSTRUCTIONS:

It is assumed that your local project repository is named "SimpleABXTester"

1. Obtain LAME v3.99.5 source code, and extract it to some directory, for 
example "LAME_SRC_DIR". Depending on your extraction philosophy, you might end 
up with a intermediate folder called "lame-3.99.5", so the entire source then 
resides in "LAME_SRC_DIR/lame-3.99.5"

2. Copy .../LAME_SRC_DIR/lame-3.99.5/libmp3lame to .../SimpleABXTester/jni and 
   select yes if asked to merge folders.

3. Copy .../LAME_SRC_DIR/lame-3.99.5/mpglib to .../SimpleABXTester/jni/libmp3lame

4. Copy .../LAME_SRC_DIR/lame-3.99.5/include/lame.h to .../SimpleABXTester/jni/libmp3lame


Now you need to modify some lines. Some modifications are due to the changed 
folder structure, and some are due to the guide I was following in order to 
compile lame for android, since I was a newbie.


5. In ".../SimpleABXTester/jni/libmp3lame/mpglib_interface.c"

- insert lines at line 27
		#define HAVE_MPGLIB 1
		(newline)
		
- replace line 
		#include "interface.h"
  with
		#include "mpglib/interface.h"
		

		
6. In ".../SimpleABXTester/jni/libmp3lame/set_get.h"

- replace line
		#include <lame.h>
  with
		#include "lame.h"


		
7. In ".../SimpleABXTester/jni/libmp3lame/util.h"

- replace line
		extern ieee754_float32_t fast_log2(ieee754_float32_t x);
  with
		extern float fast_log2(float x);
		

		
8. In ".../SimpleABXTester/jni/libmp3lame/mpglib/interface.c"

- replace lines
		#include "lame.h"
		#include "machine.h"
		#include "VbrTag.h"
  with
		#include "../lame.h"
		#include "../machine.h"
		#include "../VbrTag.h"

- insert lines at line 43
		(newline)
		#define HAVE_MPGLIB 1



9. In ".../SimpleABXTester/jni/libmp3lame/mpglib/layer3.c"

- replace lines
		#include "lame.h"
		#include "machine.h"
		#include "encoder.h"
		#include "lame-analysis.h"
  with
		#include "../lame.h"
		#include "../machine.h"
		#include "../encoder.h"
		#include "../lame-analysis.h"

		
		
10. In ".../SimpleABXTester/jni/libmp3lame/mpglib/mpglib.h"

- replace line
		#include "lame.h"
  with
		#include "../lame.h"

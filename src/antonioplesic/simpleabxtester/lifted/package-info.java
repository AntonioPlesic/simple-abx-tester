/** This package contains non-library code that was found online and was mostly
 *  written by someone else, with very little modifications, if any, from the developer of
 *  the app. As such found code fitted the needs of the app almost perfectly, without
 *  the need of modifications (or only slight), just copy-pasting it would be inappropriate
 *  and dishonest (illegal too), especially since app is partially intended to showcase this app's author's 
 *  programming skills. Original authors of the included non-trivial code are credited in the 
 *  appropriate classes, but they are in no way affiliated with this app. Their code was simply 
 *  considered too perfect for what it was needed to not to use as is.

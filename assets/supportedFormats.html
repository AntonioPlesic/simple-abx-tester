<h1>Supported formats and limitations</h1>
</header>

<p>Following input formats are currently supported across the whole application, and can serve as lossless sources in automated test modes:<br>
<ul>
<li>FLAC - stereo, 16 bits/sample, sample rate 44.1kHz</li>
<li>WAV - stereo, 16 bits/sample, sample rate 44.1kHz, uncompressed signed linear PCM</li>
</ul>
<p>Self-prepared tracks mode in addition to previous formats supports:</p>
<ul>
<li>MP3 - stereo, sample rate 44.1kHz</li>
Decoding is provided by <u>mpg123 based</u> (mpglib) decoder that is included in LAME v3.99.5 library.
</ul>
Support for more resolutions and sample rates is planned/being looked into. However, up to version 5.0, vanilla Android offers very little with regard to audio: only 16 bits per sample resolution, and only 44.1kHz & 48kHz sample rates. Android 5.0 supposedly changes these limitations, so app will probably get upgraded in the future</p>

<p>Other formats/decoders are planned (ogg definitely, hoping for m4a/aac too).</p>
